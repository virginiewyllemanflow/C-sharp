C# is used to make interactive websites, mobile apps, video games, augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR), back-end services, and desktop applications.

## Characteristics of C#

<!--strong and statical typing helps to prevent bugs-->
- strongly typed (requires you to specify data types)
- statically typed (will check the correct types have been used before running the program)
- object-oriented
- programming language (compiled)
- runs on .NET framework

## Conventions in C#

- use camelCase for variables
- use PascalCase for methods and classes
- use only letters, underscores, and digits in variable names
- every statement ends with a semicolon ( ; )
- some keywords are reserved and should not be used as variable names e.g. `return`, `break`, `out`, `continue`...
